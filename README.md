# ZPatchViewer for Directory Opus

A Directory Opus plugin to view the contents of ZPatch data files

It currently supports ZPatch Data Files version 2 and above.

Version 1 is currently unsupported due to the way the files data were stored - the files would need to be fully uncompressed to be able to see their content.

## Installation

1. Copy 64-bit `ZPatchViewer.dll` file to `/home/Viewers` if using 64-bits Directory Opus
2. Copy 32-bit `ZPatchViewer.dll` file to `/home/x86/Viewers` if using 32-bits Directory Opus

## Use

Open the viewer pane (defaults to F7 key) and click a `.ZPatch` file, it will display the contents of the file
